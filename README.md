# Calculator App (Uncompleted)

This is a simple calculator project that I started but haven't yet completed. It was intended to be a web-based calculator application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. While it's not fully functional at the moment, I'd like to share what I've done so far.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to create a basic calculator that could perform arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator was supposed to have a user-friendly interface and display both the input and the result.

## Features (Incomplete)

- [ ] Basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).
- [ ] User-friendly interface with a number pad.
- [ ] Display for both user input and the calculation result.
- [ ] Clear button to reset the input and result.

## Project Status

As of now, the calculator project is incomplete, and several features are missing. The following components are yet to be implemented:

- [ ] The logic for performing arithmetic calculations.
- [ ] Styling and layout improvements for a more polished appearance.
- [ ] JavaScript functions to handle user input and calculations.
- [ ] Responsive design to ensure usability on different screen sizes.
- [ ] Error handling for invalid input or division by zero.

## Getting Started

Since this project is not yet completed, there are no installation or usage instructions available. However, if you'd like to contribute to the project or help complete it, you can clone the repository and start working on the missing features.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hardelzs/calculator-project.git
cd calculator-project
